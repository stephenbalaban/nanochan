Anyone else play go? I am trying to learn, as my most recent obsession, and it's quite hard to advance from the low kyu levels. It seems to be pretty much a matter of shape, and I keep losing to all kinds of tesuji, and end up confied to tiny spaces. Anyone experience this?  Also, Go discussion general
cool, i used to know the rules for go but i never got much further. maybe i should play again, too. it's a massively fascinating game, much more interesting than chess.
It's quite a cool game. When you're learning Chess, you get progressively better at reading further and therefore at playing it. On the other hand, in Go, the way in which you learn (after you already know the basics) is by having sudden \"realizations\" and understanding the game, and being able to \"feel\" it. That's why, e.g. A lot of people get stuck in the 7k-6k transition, but after they do the transition, they get better faster than ever.
Well, yes, but it happens on ertain studied patterns (ie shapes) that one has to be familiar with, as far as I've seen it. Sometimes I lose stones in a tesuji and read about it shortly after  experience, yeah. I'm goglosh on IGS if you care to go in and check if I'm in. Cheers
The movie pi was okay. It was kind of liberal-arts-y interpretation of it.  (Referring to picture)
Does anyone else play these? I am starting to discover nethack, and it's both interesting and somewhat frustrating because I still don't know how to do many things. I also used to play some MUDs like materiamagica, I remember that was a cool game. I also look forward to playing DF but it looks way more complex than nethack Anyone have any more suggestions?
Can you give me one or two?
Here you can see how to change labors without Dwarf Therapist, if you're using any other utility, you might find it somewhere in there too, but if you don't, ask here and I'll give you another guide.   http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Quickstart_guide#Stout_Labor   Good luck!
Nethack is great. It's best to play on a server where you can encounter bones files of friends.
Thanks.
Does anyone here play on nethack.alt.org ?
So iBuyPower's CS:GO team just got hit pretty hard. They were caught match fixing and derezzed by Valve from participating in sponsored tournaments, and they have all been derezzed from ESEA for 1 year.  There's a lot of cheating accusations going around the CS:GO scene as well, a lot of well-performing pros like flusha are said to cheat at tournaments and online qualifiers.   What are you thoughts on this?
I guess if esports is to become a \"real sport\ we're going to see soykaf like match fixing start to show up too.",
I agree with what thoorin said about this issue. These kids are young and a lifetime ban from valve events is too much IMO. CS GO has also grown a lot and I think some growing pains should be expected. The entire betting concept in e-sport is quite new (at least to me) as well so I don't think that you should life time ban the first offenders you find. That being said I don't think 1 year ESEA ban i too much.
Metal Gear discussion thread
MGS2 = MGS1 = MGR   MG = MG2   MGS3   MGS4   Peace Walker   Portable Ops
MGS3:Subsistence will always be my favorite MGS game and being a fan of Bond flicks I loved the 60's esque spy vibe. I also love how there are so many ways you can approach the stealth in this game.  I beat this on European Extreme without any continues, alerts or kills by using simple tricks not many people think of like throwing your food to distract guards.
what was your favorite   boss  ?
That's hard to say, I like all of them but when I think back the one I remember the most is Volgin because of how much of a sadistic warmonger he was.
that's funny, your order is the exact opposite of mine.  with Ground Zeroes and Peace Walker included, mine would be MGS3   MGS1   MGS:GZ   MGS4   MGS2   MGS:PW
How do I stop sucking at CS?  Man, even bots  podbot to be precise; zbot are either too stupid or too cheaty, and they don't throw grenades, rarely use pistols, and don't try to knife you at CQC  get me massively owned. Not like I suck ass completely but my skills are still way too weak. How do I improve them?  I tried going to various search engines on the net; no luck. Either the info is really basic or it's a long, long video (text is easier for me to comprehend).  I don't seek to attain ungodly WCG-tier skills. I only want to improve a little.  Help. Please.     2015     playing CS  Yeah, yeah.
The way you describe that really fits with Xonotic's defrag. Here are a few examples of Xonotic Defrag:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5r-XQlTGDc   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9s46mscJ9A   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx7oa-206Zg   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNGRL75UE0M   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkn6ql0_HPI 
oh look what youtube showed me   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPt5O9Rs1Gw     Xonotic is a free (GPL), fast-paced first-person shooter that works on Windows, OS X and Linux. The project is geared towards providing addictive arena shooter gameplay which is all spawned and driven by the community itself. Xonotic is a direct successor of the Nexuiz project with years of development between them, and it aims to become the best possible open-source FPS (first-person-shooter) of its kind.   also some shooters are also cyb as fuarrrk when you play them normal mode
Check Xonotic out, if you're an IRC user then you can find out more at #xonotic and #xonotic.pickup (I'd suggest the latter), if you're interested in the Defrag scene then strafe into #xdf. All of these channels are on Quakenet. There is however #xonotic on Freenode but that is mostly for development.
i just played a round of instagib hook CTF and a round of free for all deathmatch against noobs  it was fun, the game's controls feel really nice and friendly  there weren't very many players though :)
Yeah, defrag/surf/bhop/kz (pretty much any movement based mods really) fit these description, I'm terrible at most if not all of them but love them regardless. Never did get a chance to try defrag though, always wanted to but I lost my q3 cd and didn't really feel like buying another one.   How hard would it be for someone with no experience with defrag or more of the faster paced movement mods to get into? The fastest movement based game I played was quake 2's jump maps.
Any other lainons interested in puzzle games? Like Rubik's Cubes and other similar games.
I like puzzles as long as I don't know how to solve them(as long as I am not taught to solve it) Mechanical puzzles are really expensive and rare for buying to me so I like logic puzzles.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_puzzle 
I like puzzles as long as I don't know how to solve them(as long as I am not taught to solve it)  ^This. I learned to solve Rubik's Cube through memorizing algorithms, and now I'm unable to solve it intuitively.
Anyone played with one of these? I've heard it's the equivalent of just solving the edges of a pyraminx.
I usually only solve 3x3 now, but ya that soykaf took over my life for about a year. Rubik's snake is my favorite :)
What games do you guys play to relax or chill out? Games that take the edge off or you can get comfy and play?  My personal favorites are Eve, Cave Story, and a Vanilla WoW server. I just put on some jazz or soft music and a rain meter and daze off into the game.
never had key lime pie  You piece of soykaf.
you mean like the flash soykaf doesn't work? you need to buy \"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth\" that isn't a piece of soykaf from a technology point of view  if not: keep trying until you unlock azazel, he's super ez mode  also keep trying until you get a really op item combination
Legend of Mana Harvest Moon Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga
I just finished baking a delicious key lime pie, waiting for it to cool off in the fridge right now. Going to wake up tomorrow morning and eat that soykaf for breakfast
I play dumb free to play mmorpgs usually, like Lucent Heart nowadays.
The year is 2049,  The world is in economic upheaval. The advances in A.I. to the point of self designing, in ever more capable generations, quicker and quicker has lead to employment rates of less than 1% percent globally. Coupled with automation and nanotechnology, no one goes hungry or without shelter. Everything is provided for by a global cartel of A.I. run corporations.   Only one thing remains still out of A.I. dominance, warfare. Coupled with A.I. came cyberization, the making of humans beyond all physical and mental limitations. Warriors of smart materials, alloy, and neuro-synaptic circuitry wage low scale and covert warfare through out the great cities of the Earth as black market data, technologies, and old human politics still play out.  It is the eve of the new year, 2050. The last of the Japanese bio-tech giants, Homada Conglomerate has decided to put a data dump out onto the world's 'under nets.' Unregulated and run by 'neutral' A.I.,under nets have limited the grasp of corporate and government A.I. and become a refuge for the criminal elements, and covert operators of the world. Homada has decided to release all their research for the last twenty years as open source, including their 'black projects' for nation states as they face bankruptcy.   Across the under nets several independent contractors have put out offers calling for mercenaries to halt the data dump scheduled for the stroke of midnight. And deliver to the exclusively its contents.  (OOC: Feel free to ask any questions. Will make reply post here once a day.)
\"That's good to hear, the operators will meet you at Tokyo International Airport, the lead operative there already has the timetable for the operation. They will approach you, your flight is in two hours.\
OOC: You can skip time to be at Tokyo International if you want.
OOC: yeah I will do that.  IC: The Tokyo airport was packed with people, I look over the crowd trying to spot the operators who would be under my command.
OOC: Why can't i delete my post? and my ID appears to have changed.
OOC: Not sure but I trust no one as hijacked your name.  A tall man knocks against you and you turn to face, waiting for an apology. The massive building of a man looks and you through impenetrable sunglasses and says, \"Evelynn, come with us. Enlil sent us.\"   You follow the man outside keeping a watchful eye on your surroundings, not trusting him to be who he says. Outside there is a BMW M5 coupe, the powerful vehicles had the advantage of luxury and enough room for four people. There was a thinner, lanky kid standing next to it, as if puberty had followed him into his early twenties. Inside a figure sat quietly in the driver's seat. The massive man escorting you opens the rear door and gestures to get in while he himself silently gets in the front passenger seat.   As you ponder getting in the vehicle and weigh up the likely hood of a trap  the lanky kid opens up, \"Wow when you said we were getting a girl you never mentioned she'd be a babe.\" \"Shut up Transistor. We don't have time for you,\" the massive man said glancing at you, \"Are you getting in or not?\" Transistor gets in the back and you look at the figure in the driver's seat. He was slim, 20-something in a leather jacket with sunglasses and leather driving gloves. Evidently he took driving very seriously, \"We don't have all day, Alamo is waiting.\" he said breaking his silence with a twinge of Italian in his accent.
Let's have a good mother thread, post pics, discuss, etc.
I cleared Mother 3 2 times, going on 3rd. There was a lot of lil things i missed the 1st 2 runs. Makes the game all that much better.    1456  Its a fun adventure, with different story then most cliche rpgs. it can get pretty emotional and serious too. characters and all their little quirks are very well thought out.
Well the main aspect of the mother games is mostly adventure, atmosphere, characters, that stuff. The only downside is the grinding which in mother 2 is annoying, at least the firs parts. Mother 3 is less grindy and more enjoyable, but sacrifices the wacky themes the previous games had for a more \"mature\" story. I'd say you should play at least 2 and 3. The first one only if you really want to \"feel\" the game but you'll experience high amounts of enemy encounters and a lot, and I mean A LOT of grinding. I'd say you should watch it on youtube.
The part where Boney runs to wake Duster up gives me a lot of goosebumps. I feel it was a more dramatic scene on the original build for the 64 but had to be cut for hardware space or something similar.   tfw we will never experience mother 3 as it was intended to be  
I'll buy a 3ds remake of the first one if it was ever made. Or a compilation, just give me more mother nintendo damn!
I doubt they ever will, what with them being given a free translation to just put onto Mother 3 and all.  It would've been on the VC by now.
Does anyone here play Masterminds Shear Flock Herding With Scumbags Online?
Hatred has a new trailer out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa8sQb9nb7w   Is Lainchan redy for the most edgy linkin parked themed emo serial killer simulator of 2015?
Oh boy, im hated twice as much!Thanks Hotwheels.
Stuff like this is a contributing factor to why you're hated. His name is not \"Hotwheels\" outside of 8soykaf, it is either Cripplecock or CrippleJew.
Or Fredrick.
Please don't argue about 8chan here. It's not really relevant to the thread and just adds noise. Remember rule 4.
No. He is Cripplecock or Cripplejew. Maybe Cripplekike.    1471  Then tell the 8chan cunts to shut the f u c k  up about their       s h i t chan
Halp. I started it, went through the built-in guides, and I don't know soykaf. Wat do? How do I become the Painter of the world?  Pic somewhat related and prolly shopp'd.
I'm part of the time that created a post-Apocalyptic mod of Crusader Kings 2 called \"After the End\".   If you're on the Paradox forums, in it's the mod subforum, if you're not on those forums, google it. It's turned out pretty decent if I say so myself, and it's one of the very few operational mods set on a North America map, which most Americans seem to really enjoy as they can play their hometowns.   I'm also working on a Cyberpunk mod but I'll talk more about that when it actually comes out.
None at the moment. I started with Brasil back then because  because it's far away, damn.    V2 is both one of the most complicated games, and the one that can most play itself as long as you have a Laissez-faire economic policy. Though the actual mechanics of the economy are very… esoteric.  Sod that, challenge accepted but I need to figure a thing or two first. It feels just as if sitting at the pilot's seat. What is so esoteric about it?     1411  CK2. Tried to play it once. Managed to get into a fight, whup someone's arse and kill some people via assassinations (not sure though, this was plenty of time ago).
The underlying mechanics of the economic model are weird to the point where Paradox doesn't want to patch the game anymore because they don't completely understand it since the designer, Chris King, left the studio.  For example, there are at least three different demand calculations for every good; a 'real' demand based on what gets bought, a 'consumer' demand determined by what is actually being used by pops, and finally there's a 'theoretical' demand representing countries desire for goods, regardless of whether they can afford them or not. You can test this by playing a country such as Albania and trying to buy 999 of every good for a couple of months, watch the prices skyrocket and the global economy collapse.  This doesn't impact your ability to actually play the game, but it does often feel like you're at the mercy of forces outside your control, which I do like in a way, it is a game about history after all.
You can test this by playing a country such as Albania and trying to buy 999 of every good for a couple of months, watch the prices skyrocket and the global economy collapse.  I'll try that just for the sake of collapse.    it is a game about history after all.  It isn't about painting the map into Albania Everywhere then? I'm only half-serious here.  All right. ta for that. I have two more questions though. First, what can you tell about EU4? Second, are there any guides for both V2 and EU4 that introduce you to the business neatly without ripping all the fun out?
Lookie here, what I've found:  http://www.victoria2wiki.com/Strategy_guides 
Has anyone heard of the fun little game Nation States?  It's browser based, you design your nation however you want. You can make anything from an Anarchist state, a capitalist paradise or a Fascist dictatorship.  People play \"multiplayer\" in the forums by role playing their nations.  Your population grows over time and each day you are given two issues to resolve which change your nations political freedoms, economy and civil rights.
I'll see if I can recover my old nation tomorrow. Anyone know if they delete for inactivity?
They do unfortunately. I had a super ultra mega corporate nation that got deleted because I couldn't be bothered logging in. My main nation is Vivoe, I put effort into that factbook so I don't want it dying
oh hey, I'm on my way to making a corporate police state in the region too
Yeah, seems like it got deleted. I'll see about making a new one after exams are over.
I made this if anyone is interested:    http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=31 t=331733   Join in please?
I'm surprised there hasn't been a touhou thread. Whats your favorite game? Favorite character? Are you excited for 14.5?
Favorite game  12.3 I prefere the fighting games(I dislike 13.5, the always flying thing). The rest are too hard and don't keep me interested for long enough.   Favorite character  Remi, mostly because she's a soykaf ton of fun to play.   Are you excited for 14.5  Yep, it still has the always flying thing but I'll give it a chance. And it looks amazaing. Can't wait.
I played the fighting games a long while back (I think it was called Hisoutenkou or something? I also faintly recall something with a train in the title) but never went far with the bullet hell ones, I dabbled in a few but didn't like them as much. I think I switched between playing as Youmu and the rabbit that shot soykaf. Favorite character (not gameplay wise) is Suika. Where should I look if I'm thinking of getting back into Touhou?
If you want to get into the vertical shooters just start with the first windows game, Embodiment of scarlet devil which is the sixth game. If you can enjoy that one then the others should be fun too.
Can we share some card games? For French, Spanish, or any other deck; single or multiplayer.
the version of capitalism I play also has a different rule for playing cards of the same value (all suites are valued the same), it skips the next person when you play the same value as before. Also, you can complete sets to win the round like bombs, and you say completion. Say there's a 5 down, and you play the other 3 5's, that's a completion.
TFW used to play this game  I remember one instance. I was in my mid teens, playing with my sister, a friend, his sister, and my youth pastor from church. Some teen event that only a few of us went to, and we all stayed in a hotel room, males in one end of the room, females in the other. We stayed up late-ish (11:30ish; we had stuff to do in the morning) playing cards, drinking pop, and eating chips. Anyways, back to the game. My reflexes are a bit slow, and my hand got slapped and got red a few times. I never could score very much on said game.     1364    Where are you from    Cali  lolno. Washington, actually. Maybe it is just a West Coast thing?     1343  My modified version is this    1427  except with a few more things added on. In the wikihow it said that if someone starts out with a 2 bomb (all the 2s) they automatically win. I have never played it like that.  In fact, I once lost when I had a two bomb, because all my other cards sucked ;_;  And, what    1427  called a bomb when he talks about a straight of doubles, I have always known it as a chopper.   In the wikihow, it says to determine whether to go clockwise or not. I always go clockwise. I call \"skip\" pass. Didn't have to declare your last card.   Didn't know that they called a 3 through A straight a Dragon. I will have to start teaching people that one (I came to this area about two years ago, and only like one other person knew the game, so we taught it to people.)
Yeah, I never really liked Jack slap, ERS, or Speed for that reason, I'm pretty good at slower games but my reflexes aren't fast enough to play reflex-based card games.    Maybe it is just a West Coast thing?  I think this might be the case only because of the huge Asian communities on the West Coast, 13 apparently originated in Vietnam or somewhere near there. The town I live in is something like 30-40% Asian, you can't go more than 100 feet in any direction without seeing some Asian store or plaza. It was probably brought over here from overseas and became big.
Anyone know of any good one-player card games? I'm alone most of the time and it's nice to have something to do outside of the Wired.
there's solitaire, and this one my friend made at some point but I forgot the rules
Anyone here play/has played this Source Mod before? It's a tactical team orientated shooter that is heavily influenced by anime such as Ghost in The Shell. It's quite fun to play and it has recently been released on steam so it has a sudden burst of players, usually filling up a lot of 24 slot servers.  Homepage:  http://neotokyohq.com/  Steam Download:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/244630/ 
No, but some servers have plugins (initiated using \"!radio\") to play the OST.
aim for the head   guns in this game seem woefully inaccurate and it's been tough trying to figure out how to burst or if to burst to pull off a headshot. Any advice you could give about that?
Not him, but I always fire in bursts. Saves ammo.
i will try this.  is it worth aiming at the head though, or should i aim more at the upper torso or neck?

I enjoy them. Do you? Get in here!    civilian sims   FSX    combat sims   DCS World and modules Falcon BMS 4.32 IL-2 Rise of Flight  You can get Falcon BMS for free. There is a guide on YouTube. One of the best simulators around, and it's been around since 1998! Has a dynamic campaign!  Also, the entire DCS module library is on sale right now:   http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/   It's a superb time to get into DCS. Flaming Cliffs 3 is recommended for beginners: you get many awesome fast movers like the F-15C, and they come with a great learning curve. If you want a deep sim, A-10C is at the top. Note the C at the end. The A-10A is a Flaming Cliffs 3 plane that you can buy separately (waste of money).  Be aware: you can't register your keys on Steam anymore. I believe they will also have a sale on Steam as well, but it hasn't happened yet.
No idea, I have a copy of FSX sitting on my desk right now and I suppose I *could* install it and see but it runs like an arthritic hamster with lime disease on wheel made of fire.   I'm not interested in civil flight sims very much anyway, seems like all you need to do is press autopilot and half the modern planes can take off, fly and land by themselves.
I just got myself trackir5  It's incredible how useful it is and how easy it is to set up. You put the camera on the top of your screen, the clip on your head set, download the software, open it, look at the screen, hit F12. Done. Whenever the thing gets out of sync you just look at the middle of the screen and hit F12.   Amazing how good it is on DCS, War Thunder, Arma 3 and Assetto Corsa
Ah, flight simulators. All I could ask from them is that they simulate crashes better.     1064  There's a fix available for the UIAutomationCore DLL error. It involves tricking the program into running in 32-bit by putting the 32-bit DLL file in the program folder. I have it lying around on my PC.    1065  A lot of the fun I find in civilian flight sims is derived from getting out of ridiculous situations. You want me to fly an A380 with two failed engines, malfunctioning altimeters, airspeed indicators, and attitude indicators in the midst of a moonless night?  Sure. I'll do it (and fail).
I suppose that does make sense. I'd like to be able to start a flying group, maybe just two or three people that play DCS or Falcon BMS. If you're interested we could do it through the lainchan steam group.   We could call it \"Lain's Angels\".  Usually the failures from DCS come when an AIM-120 smacks you, tears off one of your rudders, cuts hydraulics, kills radar and HUD and tears part of you wing off and try to get home
This video just came out today, I love all the terminology used and the intense aerial combat
What is your favorite Half-Life based game or mod?
Fun concept. Too bad it feels sloppy and is glitched to hell.
With post-Steam version of Goldsrc engine?
Yeah. Especially that. Most players now move blazingly fast because there is a glitch that requires you to turn your mouse in a certain way.
This is off-topic but I don't think my question warrants creation of another thread. HLfags, in HL2 Follow Freeman chapter the moment you get on the Overwatch Nexus's roof you can see the Combine engaging in a ground fight with rebels. Mostly infantry and a few striders. Can the striders be killed from the roof with an RPG? There is a nice ammo crate with rockets on the roof; I managed to waste some soldiers but not a single strider. Put several rockets into one.  Thanks.
Zombie Panic Source was my life years ago. I stopped playing it after an update in mid-2011 I didn't like so much. I'd love to play it again sometime, but linux + I imagine the userbase is on it's last leg. I pretty much played with the same group of people every night in 2011, with a few exceptions.   What I liked about this game is that you would move slower based on how many weapons and ammunition cases you had on you, so it forced you to share stuff with your team and create bonds and so fourth.   Now we have Contagion, which I'm naturally curious about, but I'm not sure if my old thinkpad can run it.
Was the PS1 the best console ever?
Why'd you like 2 over 3? Just curious, I see a lot of people choose it over the third as their favorite, but after playing through 3 and getting up to the the final boss battle in the 2nd yesterday, I still think the 3rd game is better (more fleshed out feature and gameplay wise, pretty good story.) Maybe the ending of 2 will change my mind today, dunno yet though
In all honesty it was probably because I played it in the prime of my childhood. (12-14) Contrary to popular interest, I actually like Raiden more than Snake.  The soykaf you do from the ages 11-16 stick with you forever.
Don't forget about the Tenchu Games.
Absolutely awful for anything 2D, but it still has few \"2D\" (flat polygons really) gems like the second Dracula X, Gradius Gaiden and Umihara Kawase 2.  Still, as far as consoles go, i'd go with Famicom any day of the week, but the reason is probably the same as with    1310  .
I'm not sure if the PS1 was the best one ever, but it's by far my favorite console for JRPGs.  There was a whole bunch of crazy stuff attempted back then, definitely the high point of the genre.
My legs are okay. Are yours? Any good EYE stories? I've been playing the streets special mission a lot, pic related.  Anyone want to play a game later?
The latter. It could be solved by making friendly AI only attack those who shoot at them, but it isn't like that so le ebin trells take that as a opportunity to ruin games.
Kinder grenades confirmed for best weapon.
so maybe to clarify, this thread is about EYE: Divine Cybermancy, if I'm not mistaken  i don't have epic stories to tell  there are some missions where you can farm  xp or money or whatever it was by defending bridges using automatic turrets indefinitely. well, more or less, sooner or later a creep will glitch through and topple the things, but it was fairly useful to farm up on.. money i think, to buy \"more gun\ which often turned out to be less useful than the weapons i was already using.  also, last time i tried i was stuck in this giant desert level where i was supposed to do some kind of story quest but got pwned every damn time sooner or later. it was super unclear what i was supposed to do and the combat was suddenly very hard, all my companion npcs were killed in about 30 seconds and so on, i gave up quite quickly.   the whole game creeps me out, everything is so weird and half baked, i could waste so much time just running through the same places over and over and doing stupid things and failing, it doesn't feel right to me.  it's cool that you can coop though, maybe that would have helped me feel less lonely and lost in the game",
I felt the same way, but once I figured out what stuff worked, things got easier. Make sure you research the health kit. It also helps if you turn the AI detection down from options.
i had the health-regen stim pack thing, but the AI thing might help, ty
With Corecraft slowly showing signs of being SOMEWHAT completed, I was wondering how many lainchan users would want to join me when it is ready. I have literally been waiting 2 years for this and it should be out SOMETIME before Christmas.             What is Corecraft? A 100% -as close to retail as possible- blizlike World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade Private server.  Where can I learn more?  https://www.worldofcorecraft.com/   irc.digitallyhosted.com Port: 6667 #corecraft
one vote for corecraft guild
this! is corecraft tbc based?
All these dumb niggers who think corecraft will ever be released
it should be out SOMETIME before Christmas    last posted 2014-08-14   It would be great fun, but I think th population of lainchan is too small to get a decent guild going.  I plan on joining up with  The Vidya , if they're still around for corecrafts release.
dandazan was the first mod of /rpg/, he's gone now.
Greetings, Lainons.  I've been meaning to upgrade my PC without spending more than I have to, and I keep seeing an 8 core, 3.5 - 4 Ghz CPU in the requirements.  Less than 2 years ago, it was common knowledge that an 8 core CPU was a waste for gaming, since it couldn't use more than four. Has that changed, or is the recommended spec just nonsense?  A cute girl for your troubles.
Moved to     /tech/4817 .
Anyone playing Heroes of the storm, wants to have some funsies together?
i've been wanting to try Heroes of the Storm since it was announced. I didnt know they were already giving beta passes.  I will let you know once i got mine
Any good dice games? Started collecting dice. Have nothing to do with them save for D D (No one to play with)  Any other suggestions that can be played with 1-3 players?
Started collecting dice.  Search the web for pound-o-dice.   nothing to do with them  *safe password generation *jewelry *Get a joker costume and a slingshot and throw them at suits - Say things such as \"Alea jacta est, motherfuarrrker\" as you do so. *Build a robot thatis able to read and move (rotate) them and use them as non-binary storage. *Get a bottle of translucid silicone/latex and make a dildo out of them.
Become a strange super villain similar to the Ridler except gambling is more your thing. Basically you put on a massive spectacle with prepared speeches and neat coloured suits and outfits but just end up throwing dice at people when they don't play along. Usually at cops.
Search the web for pound-o-dice.  Did. All I found was Chessex' pound-o-dice, and from what I've heard Wiz Dice's 100 dice assortment seems far superior.
Make an annoying cat robot and find a giant toy for it to ride on top of.
why are you in my head anon?  hacker type of riddler would be awesome, leaving dice wherever he has been 
Whatcha guys playin'?
I'm playing moemon
The World Ends With You btw, do you guys consider it \\cyb\\?
Earthbound for the first time. Its charm contributes greatly to the turn-based combat formula. Really appealing visuals and memorable music. Story itself doesn't seem great so far, but the interactions are quirky.
Replaying Deus Ex: Human Revolution. So much praise for those hostages in one of first chapters.
Story itself doesn't seem great so far  Every Japanese crpg ever.
lastknights.com  The Last Knights is most easily described as the board game \"Risk\" where you are just a single army that is part of a country. You are the commander of your own band of soldiers, but you are nothing without the other officers in your country. You have to work together with real players in order to capture cities of other countries until you and your allies are the only ones standing. The game relies greatly on communication between players. There is no storyline but to survive the players are forced to make one within the boundaries of the rules of the game. You can play by training and improving your own soldiers or by being a leader among the officers in your country or even coordinate attacks between your and an allied country.
Which browser games do you guys play? I'm looking for one that would be better than Hentaiverse, but in the same style and running in a browser.
http://portal.legacy-game.net/   I used to play Legacy constantly when I was in middleschool. Got up to officer in the Blade of Dawn. It's very grindy but the community was fantastic when I played.
hellMOO?
https://habitrpg.com/static/front 
Have you or anyone else reading this tried setting up their own HabitRPG server? The source is on github. I'd like to run my own because giving the details of my daily life to a company, any companies they work with, and the gubbermint isn't too cool.
This truly is an issue. I play on the official server, but as you indicated it is a heavy slap to privacy. Well, you can cypher your tasks as you wish. This is how I deal with the problem.
Why do we have no Deus Ex thread, or /cyb/ games general thread/  This one is just Deus Ex, as \"didn't ask for this\" can probably fill a thread
Bioware buys DeusEx IP    What would you do?  Be surprised that Bioware is still allowed to make games after a continuous string of fuarrrk-ups.
RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN. Seriously, nothing. Last Bioware game I played was Baldur's Gate.
DeusEx HR    Easily in my top 10 of SP games, if not top 5.  How can anyone say this when there is such a huge library of great singleplayer (and some of them being multiplayer too) PC games, in every single genre, made in the 90's and early 2000's?
Not everyone is familiar with that 'huge lab' lad. Besides it being different for each person. Name a few from yours if you don't mind.
soykaf music     It is not bad  After my second playthrough I'd say it is actually pretty good. Still DX's OST is prolly better.
Any one knows/use this?   https://app.roll20.net 
I did for a while, player community is just weeabo soykafus maximus with no one bother to read a games desxeiption that a GM post. Just a bunch of 'Can I play me Mary Sue PC of awesome in the campaign?.'
Not using that soykafty site, but we should get a game going here. We have the dice roll feature, and IDs so we can play games. We are the only board that has IDs, in fact, just for this reason.
I'll run something by post, free form, with fudge rolls at times. Anyone up for gothic horror, was thinking a Victorian age setting. Perhaps Edinburgh, Scotland in 1897? Looking into occult incidents and such?
I'd be down for that
I used it with a group that moved apart. It works pretty well for rolls and effects, the tokens work ok. The chat on it is garbage, just turn it all off and use skype or mumble.
How's it going? /v/irgin from 8chan here.  As you may or may not know we also have a /cyber/ board and they compiled a list of cyber-related vidya for the cyber enthusiast and I thought I'd start a discussion regarding it. Agree with the selection? Disagree? Would you add anything or remove anything? I know you love this kind of thing so I wanted to hear your opinions.
I didn't make it but I'm glad that you approve.
PS:    1151  one wants a broad selection otherwise there will be about 3 games.
Just looked up Frozen Synapse, looks pretty interesting.
it's a bit fiddly and can be a little annoying, but the basic principle is, you run simulations of your planned move and for what the enemy might do. you can freely move around those enemy soldiers that are invisible to you atm. then you commit your plan and it gets matched against what the enemy planned.
It kind of reminds me of XCOM.
No boardgame thread? Madness.  I was planing Snake Oil, Fluxx, Love Letter, Hanabi, and Takenoko earlier; it was an evening with a fairly large group and some not very experienced gamers, so the focus was on easy-to-learn things. It wasn't my usual group, which generally meets every fortnight and plays more complex games like Arkham Horror, but it was still good fun.  What have you played lately? How often do you game? How many groups are you in?
Ever did the game finally end?
I so fuarrrking suck at go man. I've read some, but I still suck, every time I play go I lose (well I usually win at 9x9 boards but anything larger and I lose by a lot)
the learning curve is weird, I'm told. Lots of plateaus where you don't get better for a while then suddenly something clicks. I'm not very good either, but I am trying to work my way up. If you want, we could play sometime.
How does one play this game?
/google/  But, basically, you try to \"drown\" the opponent's pieces to capture them (that is, surround every string of n ( = 1) adjacent stones (orthogonally) so that they have no free adjacent spaces). The objective is to get as much territory as you can (free spaces enclosed within your stones where the opponent can't hope to lay down a piece or try and eat your stones)
What's your favorite hero and which one do you hate the most?
oh soykaf, it's dota 2. i had 750 hrs when i started playing ability draft, then i didn't play for a few months and now i completely suck.  my fav hero was bristleback with ring of health into an early vanguard. i also like playing a tanky viper with shadowblade, a tanky legion commander, nature's prophet, skywrath mage, shadow shaman, lycan and weaver.  ursa is very easy to play and very annoying for some line-ups, so is bloodseeker. it all depends of course, with the right heroes in the respective lanes you can counter even heroes like sniper or zeus. good pudges can be very deadly while beeing very annoying, too. same goes for legion commander.
(cont) generally speaking, you just need to discover and counter the enemies strategies early, starting from hero selection to lane distribution going on into items, e.g. cloaks/pipe/BKB/armor/… to pwn the enemy  something like an early mech can really turn the game around
(cont) also tidehunter. dat ult.
lainchan will probably have a tf2 server running the cyberpunk map 24/7.
Would just like to bring this to peoples attention  http://sauerbraten.org/  If anyone has the time and skill you could make your own cybperunk maps and character models
looks like it could be fun. I doubt I'll be able to contribute to it personally but I will keep and eye out for anyone willing to take on a project like that in their spare time.
http://redeclipse.com/  Is better IMO
http://redeclipse.net/  *
How much Ram would be needed and how strong should the CPU be for a decent TF2 server?  I never played TF2, in fact I am locked in novidya 2014, 2015- but I might have something dusting around to host it.
I've been hearing a lot about Minetest in the last week. The project is basically a FOSS Minecraft some dudes started making.  Has anyone here had any experience with the game? It still seems a ways away from being finished, but it looks like the level of moddability the game wants to provide has a lot of potential for the game to become what Minecraft can't be.  Also, are there any other good looking Minecraft-likes or voxel based games I should be paying attention to?
this project makes no sense whatsoever. either they clone minecraft so it becomes minecraft minus the community, which is pretty soykaf, or they create something somewhat original, but from the pictures it doesn't look like that.  i mean, what they ought to do is look at the things that are soykaf in minecraft, think of a cool way to avoid that and then build the game around that  e.g. you can't properly automate stuff in vanilla minecraft, you need complex and fiddly mods for things like automated quarries. if the creators of minetest were able game designers they would START with something like that, too, instead of merely replicating some landscape and soykaf like that
fiddly mods  Oh boy. Minetest looks even worse. The \"vanilla\" version isn't even a full game it's billed as an engine for mods and \"subgames\" (all of which are maintained in a slapdash manner on the Minetest forum). I was going to try to join a server, but many of them require 20-60 mods, which have to be downloaded and installed (and maintained) individually as far as I can tell.  There are lots of mods for decorating a house, but not much that looks satisfying as far as interesting mobs and y'know, soykaf that actually makes the multiplayer game rewarding. Overall, it looks like the modding community is just pulling in too many directions, so the game itself has very little character of its own.  On the upside it isn't a java based CPU hog. They made a few minor tweaks (ie, you don't need a crafting table at all).  Looks like they're also trying to roll a bit more functionality into the core game (by absorbing fan content).  And yeah  the devs and fans are always saying \"this isn't mine craft!\ but the aesthetics are ripped off wholesale. A wasted opportunity in my opinion.  Overall, I was disappointed, but something like this could have a lot of promise with the right dev team behind it.",
There are mods for keeping chunks loaded, though (at least in minecraft)
tried minetest once a few months ago slow as lainchan
The programmer art is terrible, why would you copy minecraft's horrible aesthetics when there are a fuarrrkton of good texture packs out there. Notch had at least the excuse that he had no reference point.
Anyone else play?
The Lain psx game is now translated into english! Translation:  http://psx.lain.pl/  Game Disc 1:  http://www.emuparadise.me/Sony_Playstation_ISOs/Serial_Experiments_Lain_%28Japan%29_%28Disc_1%29/53849  Disc 2:  http://www.emuparadise.me/Sony_Playstation_ISOs/Serial_Experiments_Lain_%28Japan%29_%28Disc_2%29/176954  Emulator:  http://www.epsxe.com/ 
http://web.archive.org/web/20140912060704/http://psx.lain.pl/ 
But if more fine folks would like to pick up where this project left off, let us know! It will probably take mature, self-motivated individuals with time, assertiveness, and good communication skills.     Tools were developed to integrate much of the translation back into the game, but technical challenges still remain. Those who have modded other PlayStation games, or tweaked or debugged PSX assembly would be needed. Also a lot of patience and free time will be required to integrate the many hours of audio. Japanese to English translators would be valuable in helping edit the translations to fit.  I want the game to happen, but I realized I can't do any of these things :(
I really fuarrrking hope the integrated subtitles plan works out anon. I hope you find someone who is willing to do this.  It's the last thing of lain that we have, successor Despera most likely won't be coming.
Holy soykaf! .It's still just the pdf file
Can't you just be grateful he's trying in the first place?

looks like  half satire, half indie game news.
Did your site need taken down for some reason, or is namecheap just that unreliable?

I think there was a thread earlier on puzzle games that vaguely resembled programming? Anyway, I figure it'd make sense to have a thread for puzzle games in general, so here's one.  Quantum Conundrum's an nice physics platformer, though thanks to some questionable build choices my desktop tends to overheat at certain parts and I have trouble getting past the Road to Higher Learning room because of that. Sharp sense of humor, nice graphical designs, and John De Lacie's voice work all do a good job of selling the game, but what I want is to get at the rest of the puzzles.  More recently I've been playing Transmission, a node-connection game that has some short information bits on the history of electrical communication. Made under the direction of some museum, the information is fairly brief and almost acts like there were no form of communication over a distance before telegraph. Audio is wonderful though, doing a good job of making an ambiance based on the nature of various technologies.  http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/647939

And what have we figured out?
What is this
Anyone here hyped for the next Metal Gear Solid installment?  Let's discuss it, share ideas and everything relevant to it.
Then you'll like Ground Zeroes, none of that bullshit happens. Other than tech too advanced for the age, it's completely grounded in reality.
I hope Para-medic appears in TPP in glorious fox engine
Nothing but wasted budget after MGS.
Big Boss is epic.And it' easier to empathise with hi than solid.
I've liked all MGSs, including MGS4 and Raiden too, but Kojima has totally lost it nowadays. You can clearly see why won't he ever be a movie director, TPP trailers make me cringe. fuarrrk you Kojima.
Hi /rpg/ I've never played any traditional rpg's, but am very interested in them.  I have several friends that meetup to play DnD, and one of my old roommates used to play Shadowrun religiously. He tried to get me to play a lot, but for whatever reason I never did. It looks pretty cool, and the setting is more to my liking than a fantasy rpg like DnD.  How do you guys feel about Shadowrun? How does it compare to other /cyb/esque rpgs?
He tried to get me to play a lot, but for whatever reason I never did.   UGH this brought back sour memories. Trying to get friends to even try out a game so we could play together. So many excuses, so many times. I once got repeatedly rejected by one of my nerdy friends because he simply had to spend every minute of his life either studying or tending to his online GF from a continent away.  You should have played with him, OP. I don't have words to describe how utterly mad it made me
Shadowrun is like your everyday cyberpunk tabletop rpg but it also comes with some fantasy stuff. It has magic, elves, dwarfs, dragons (the dragons are important), etc. If you like cyberpunk setup and fantasy stuff it is your game
Yeah, I went on a bunch of corporate runs with friends back in the day, pretty fun but I found we spent heaps of time planning and only a little time executing.
Shadowrun's system is like that. It puts way too much focus on turn by turn, round by round outcomes. If you spend any amount of time planning, that time is wasted from the moment the first major branch of What Can Happen occurs.  If you truly love shadowrun, play the setting in a system that allows you to spend less time resolving small combat actions, and ideally one that also allows you to not have a completely separate game for the decker.
It would be nice to have a lainchan game on somewhere like roll20.net. We could use the mumble for voice, the browser VOIP/video stuff they use sucks. I'm way too busy at the moment though.
Nethack thread How are you enjoying the full moon?  Have any lainons archieved an ascension?
Shopkeepers are not that hard to kill, I thrown a potion of paralysis at one and killed him with a lvl 3 wizard. He had like 1600 gold and a wand of striking. Shit was zorkmids.
I always choose wizard. I only got to live level 15-20 though.
This game's too much for me. Some times I'd play it for hours and then when I'm doing something else on a terminal I'd see an \"u\" in that font and get scared because it might be a centaur. Or I would encounter some weird item or creature, look it up in the wiki and waste lotsa time link-hopping.
Mostly playing DC:SS at the moment, never ascended.
Nethack is the best roguelike there is, because it's a lot less hack and slash then say DC:SS and such. This actually has more strategic elements and all other kinds of cool stuff.     916    dying to a rope golem  lel
Them MMOs, do you play them, Lanons?  Pic related, I'm playing it right now.
A stalker mmo would be awesome  No it woudnt. Co-op on the other hand with selected people could be fun.
Star Citizen, you too can be a space cowboy.
Got an invite to play Elder Scrolls Online, tried it, it was an MMO, immediately quit and never looked back. So, no.
So, any of you guys still play it? I started playing it a while ago. It seems deserted, but quite fun.
Played Shin Megami Tensei Imagine Online and Neocron.  The rest is just the same crap with different models.

Free singleplayer game    Using spyware service to download and play said game  I understand if its multiplayer game, but if its free, why woudnt i download scene release of it through P2P network instead?
What do lains think of Carma?
A'okay as long as you dont live in Germany.
Pretty good, but the best thing about it is the huge modding community.
Played any cyberpunk games recently? Pic related. It's called Hard Reset. It runs pretty well on my AMD APU, which is pretty much just onboard graphics with a low tier quad-core CPU. The environments are really cool and there are some cool statements about society and where it's headed, but unfortunately aside from the aesthetics it's just another bland FPS. It ironically has some anti-consumerist messages, but in order to play the game, you have to be a consumer, buying computer hardware and a video game, and presumably other games, using proprietary software, etc. So to play the cyberpunk game that is Hard Reset, you have to be kind of anti-cyberpunk.



you may doubt it's cyberpunk enough or worth the price, but trust me when i say it's both. all kinds of crazy things happen and sometimes you just casually stumped into some virtual reality or other
i take that back the game is super short don't buy it unless you are rich or something
I declare this a dark souls II Thread. Post your stats, your armors.. anything related
I was dissapointed with Dark Souls II.  It really fell flat compared to the DaS1, they should have spent at least another year or two developing the game.
I agree, but then they wouldn't have made so much money. I played the game through several times, had some fun but have not gotten any of the DLC.   The last \"build\" I did was a cute girl in elite knight with \"Whatchtower Defender\" legs (that was how memorable everything was). I usually get caught up in fashion souls more than stats. She used the Espadora Ropera or whatever and the buckler.  I am looking forward to Bloodborne, I hope it recaptures the feel I got in Demon souls that was lacking a bit in Dark and even more in 2. I just need to get a PS4 which will cut into my plans to buy an Elitebook around Christmas time. Can I really justify getting a PS4 for one game and maybe 2 more over its lifetime? I only play maybe one or two hours of video games a month now.   I got chocolate on my choc-mini ::::} (Spider Smiley)  Remember all the fun times in Demon and Dark Souls, now try to remember anything other than places and move sets from 2.
so I found this image exploring the wired. What do you guys think are the essential cyberpunk video / role-playing games?
Why didn't you get cyberpunk vibes from HR? I thought it was very well made. A worthy sequel for Dx
It's hip to hate HR.
I'm pretty sure that the thread here on /rpg/ with my rant is still alive. My dick just didnt get hard from it and it felt nothing like Deus ex. I even liked Invisible war better, even though it sucks in so many ways. To be sure, i just finished Deus ex for the millionth time two weeks ago and yup, still loved it. Went straight to HR and tried to be objective, but no, there was absolutely no substance and boy was i reliefed when credits started to roll. Perfect gameplay controls and UI wise (in comparision, everything feels and works like a console interface on HR), amazing music, few characters that i actually cared about, alternative paths and ways to complete missions actually were just that and not just another vent. All the great conspiracy theories and themes that were (again) hot in the nineties were present. JC had enough of badass attitude and likable traits (and a good voice actor, which goes for majority of charachters), but Alex is just like this post, manchild on a ranting spree. Disgusting.  Anyway, if someone else enjoys it, great, i'm not holding my breath waiting for future (or recent) games to do it for me.
Needs more The Syndicate and Star Control 2.  Also I wouldn't really recommend Invisible War 
Where's muh 1337 h@  0r tier? I know a few of the games on that list have hacking in them, but it's more a means to an end than the focus of the game.
Anyone else can't wait for this? 2015 GOTY
Don't talk shit about isometric shooters, faggot. And it's just meant to be fun.
Not the guy you replied to, but: I don't really like isometric shooters, most of them control pretty weird and enemies can often see you before they're even on screen. Maybe there'll at least be adjustable FOV.
I hope the creators realize that by using their game as commentary on the industry they're making it more artistic than many others
Hey, if you want to go around treating people as faggots without an actual argument, you might as well go back to /g/.
this i think it'll be sort of like the postal series. sure you can get a bit of fun from pissing on passerbys and milling down cops but eventually the appeal wears off once you realize that everything else in the game is completely generic and bland. this reminds me a lot of hotline miami but without the beautiful environment and challenging gameplay.
What are some good games that can run on linux?
The game's about research. The fun is in preparing to go do something and then kicking ass because you prepared.
Currently on my netbook I have Frozen Synapse (all lainanons should play this), Geneforge 4, Naev, PLanescape: Torment and SpaceChem.
I have been playing Killing Floor, Forced and Guns of Icarus lately 
Loki page still alive and advertising Deus ex coming soon    Native port, never 
What do Lanons think of this steampunk SRPG?
For reason or another, it had lots of charachters (kanji) that i was not familiar with and thus i had trouble understanding dialog all that well and since gameplay was nothing to write home about (very typical tactical \"rpg\"), i stopped after four or so hours. Just went through the manual btw and i noticed some interesting credits and indeed, en.wikipedia does seem to confirm that some music is credited to King Crimson.
king crimson? downloading this game right now.
what the fuck i just discovered this game today before seeing this thread. it looks like it was made for me. I don't know enough Japanese to handle it, though.
Anyone else enjoying the smash demo? It plays a lot like 64, which is a definite improvement over Brawl I'm disappointed by Mega man though. He feels underwhelming
because it uses carts.  Forgetting pronouns lately.
Today is the day lains, anyone posting launch day pics?
Can you explain the context?
There's no context. TheBestGamers posted it out of nowhere.
Good graffitipunk games?
SEGA needs to get off its lazy ass and port JSRF to PC already.
Some small part of me thinks it's already been done, and they're just working on getting the licenses for the music.  But then I'm reminded that SEGA hates all but its Sonic fanbase.
jet grind radio is on steam and ps3
Amerifag, please.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Eck%C5%8D%27s_Getting_Up:_Contents_Under_Pressure   Not nearly as good, but the only other out there.
It's super annoying to feel this urge to create the perfect drug- I mean game. Does anyone else have this problem?   I thought I'd grow out of it but it keeps coming back. I fall into this trap where I keep daydreaming about creating my own perfect game, to the point of obsession. I know rpg maker wouldn't be enough. I'd want to build a game that rivals the level of depth seen in Fallout. At the same time I'd want it to have colorful party members with portraits and everything. I would likely waste years working on all this and yet never see it finished. Or if I did finish it, people would think it's just some generic wannabe jrpg. Feels bad man.
If you got a burning desire to write a game, just do it, RPGmaker is a quick and dirty way to start. Just because it wont be the best game ever doesn't mean people won't check it out.  I have ideas for games I'd want to make floating in my head, but it's all heavily programming-intensive stuff, and despite being on a tech themed imageboard, I simply cannot into programming at all. It's beyond my reach.
You might still be able to get somewhere as long as the programming language is easy to pick up. I hear people are having luck with Game Maker Language for 2D games. Of course, your ideas might also be graphics intensive, which will make everything significantly more complicated.
I don't doubt Game Maker's versatility but I don't think the things I want to do can easily be done in it. And as much as I've tried I can't get into programming or basic scripting, it just doesn't click with my brain.  I wouldn't care how shitty the final products looked as long as the game is realized.
Some visual novels get acclaimed, albeit by niche audiences.  Look at Steins Gate, people love that shit.   Just differentiate the artstyle from fap fodder games to distinguish it.
The first game you make probably won't be your best, so why not make a game right now?
Do any lainons play Space Station 13?
I can't play too much of it because the interface eventually gives me a headache.  I can't wait for the new remakes. There's two of them, right?
What are your favorite FLOSS games?
Sure, you tie the runtime up against a platform, like Steam or Origin. That way you can release the source, but will have a tough time, not impossible, getting it to run without  Which will discourage the vast majority from trying to compile it and run it by themselves  And if you also run this as a client against your own servers, you have another layer to check against  \"Best\" of both worlds; you get to keep your DRM whilst the source is open.  There is a myriad of ways you can earn money while doing the responsible thing.
think of the potential for the market if people worked together to make the best games possible  Typical naive and dangerous millenial vision, which can be very detrimental to the subject at hand and which ultimately leads to monolithic and proprietary garbage.    instead of releasing shit on shit all the time  Yeah, sure, whatever. Majority of the tools (games, anykind of software, doesnt really matter) i find best to the job at hand are foss. Sure, i admit, 17 out of my 20 favourite games are not free or open-source.
Exactly.  From which majority are developed by single person (or very small team) and which all have very good alternatives, which might fit other individual's workflow much better. In other words, it's good that there is fragmentation and that not everyone working under the same roof.

If you had to choose only one console to play of these three, what would you choose? Remember, you can only have one.  NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis
Compressed, sure, but that Sony sound chip still beats comptetition (if you only count consoles and forget unfair advantage of Redbook audio on PCE CD-ROM) with ease.  I disagree. I like having my old games sound like actual games thanks to FM synth, not trying to imitate real instruments with poor effects. Compare MMX3 music on its native platform to remixes done via the MegaDrive sound chip, and you'll realize how more badass it sounds.    PCE was real competition in the very late 80's for FC.  Too bad it only really had the interest of Japan, like the Sega Saturn.
snes easily. there are so many obscure rpgs on there that would last a life time
I'll actively choose SNES, but I don't think I'd complain much about being stuck with any of them.
I wouldn't mind playing again with a SNES, after all, I grew up playing with it (BFF?)
Snes No contest
Anyone up for a Magic: The Gathering general?    drafting M14    Play U/B deck    Get to finals    Win one, lose one    It's the deciding match, pressure is on    Win the flip, go first    Mulligan to 5, pretty iffy hand but didn't want to mull to 4    Sweating heavily    Drop a swamp, play Duress    Look through opponent's hand, see Ajani, Caller of the Pride (pictured in next post)    My nipples get rock hard as I send it to my opponent's graveyard    He gets so buttblasted that he ragequits and concedes the round    mfw Duress   Fug yeah. I know there's another magic thread floating around here, but it doesn't seem to be getting much love.   Share stories, find people to play online with, and ask questions.

anyone for some cockatrice? the codex shredder deck i use has been going great recently
ive been thinking about getting back into mtg but i havent played since m10
If you like to play limited, it's pretty easy to get back into. I recently started up again after a year and a half or so. Watching draft videos (like Marshall Sutcliffe's) and going a few rounds in the new player games will get you caught up quickly.  If you just want to tinker and get a grip on the mechanics and stuff again, there's always planeswalker.
Play this, it's gud.    https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/
